Handwritten Digit Classifier for MNIST Data Set

This is an interactive implementation of a neural network designed to classify handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). All hyperparameters of the network can be customized upon running the traincustom.py file, and all parameters (weights and biases) are stored for future use upon completion of the training. This implementation is adapted from Michael Nielsen's version from his Neural Networks and Deep Learning book.
